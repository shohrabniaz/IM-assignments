In the graph, the x-axis is for the number of input sizes, where the y-axis is for the computational cost. We know that The more computation cost increases, the higher it will take time to solve the problem. As the x value increases, the computation cost doesn't increase that much for theta(logn).In the graph, it shows the lowest computation cost among those 5 is theta(log n), which is marked as blue.  That means among those five thetas (log n) will be the best solution.
